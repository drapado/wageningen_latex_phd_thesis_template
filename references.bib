    abstract = {This paper presents an example methodology for LiDAR-based navigation in structured orchards, demonstrating how to format a BibTeX entry for a research paper. The proposed example framework includes a simulated LiDAR odometry system and a placeholder mapping algorithm, designed to showcase the structure of a typical academic publication. Experimental results are based on a hypothetical dataset collected in an imaginary orchard environment, with performance metrics generated for illustrative purposes. The example code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ExampleResearch/ExampleRepo, serving as a template for real research implementations.},
